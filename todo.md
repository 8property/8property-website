- [ ] Understand current deployment and integration (Render, Make.com, Instagram).
- [ ] Identify gaps and opportunities for AI and automation.
- [ ] Propose a high-level architecture for the AI-driven property agency ecosystem.

## Phase 2: Map content-to-lead funnel and define automation workflows
- [x] Define the content-to-lead funnel: Scraper -> IG -> WhatsApp/DM -> CRM.
- [ ] Specify what to scrape, what to post, and what generates interest.
- [ ] Detail the flow of data and actions within the funnel.

## Phase 3: Integrate and deploy 28Hse and Squarefoot scrapers to Flask/Render
- [x] Adapt 28Hse and Squarefoot scripts for Flask deployment.
- [ ] Deploy scrapers to Render.
- [ ] Set up scheduling for automated scraping.

## Phase 4: Build AI content enrichment system for listings
- [x] Research and select appropriate AI libraries (Pillow, NLP) for image overlays and text summaries.
- [x] Develop modules for image processing and text generation.
- [x] Integrate enrichment into the scraping pipeline.

## Phase 5: Design and implement Make.com automation workflows
- [x] Design Make.com scenarios for posting listings to Instagram.
- [x] Implement tracking for post metrics.
- [x] Configure capture of IG/WhatsApp replies into CRM.

## Phase 6: Set up CRM integration and lead tracking system
