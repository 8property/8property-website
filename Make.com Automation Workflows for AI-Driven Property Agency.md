# Make.com Automation Workflows for AI-Driven Property Agency

## Overview

This comprehensive guide details the design and implementation of Make.com automation workflows that orchestrate the entire content-to-lead funnel for your AI-driven property agency ecosystem. The workflows integrate data scraping, AI content enrichment, social media posting, lead capture, and CRM management into a seamless automated system.

## Architecture Overview

The Make.com automation system consists of several interconnected scenarios that work together to create a complete automated property marketing and lead generation pipeline. The system is designed to be modular, scalable, and fault-tolerant, with each scenario handling specific aspects of the workflow while maintaining data consistency across the entire ecosystem.

The core architecture follows a hub-and-spoke model where Make.com serves as the central orchestration platform, connecting various services including property scrapers, AI content enrichment, Instagram posting, WhatsApp integration, and CRM systems. This design ensures that data flows smoothly between different components while maintaining the flexibility to add new data sources or modify existing workflows without disrupting the entire system.

## Core Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Data Collection and Orchestration Hub

This foundational scenario serves as the central nervous system of the automation ecosystem, coordinating data collection from multiple property portals and triggering downstream processing workflows. The scenario operates on a scheduled basis, typically running multiple times per day to ensure fresh property data is continuously flowing through the system.

The scenario begins with scheduled triggers that activate data collection from each property portal. For the 28Hse scraper, the scenario makes an HTTP GET request to the deployed Flask application endpoint, typically `https://28hse-scraper.onrender.com/run`. The response contains a JSON payload with newly scraped property listings, including comprehensive details such as property titles, prices, areas, agent information, and image URLs.

Similarly, the scenario triggers the Squarefoot scraper by calling `https://squarefoot-scraper.onrender.com/run`, which returns property data in a standardized JSON format. The Centaline scraper, already deployed and operational, is also integrated into this collection cycle through its existing endpoint.

Once data is collected from all sources, the scenario performs data normalization and deduplication. This process ensures that properties appearing on multiple platforms are identified and consolidated, preventing duplicate content from being posted to social media. The normalization process also standardizes field names and data formats across different scrapers, creating a unified data structure that can be processed consistently by downstream workflows.

The scenario includes sophisticated error handling and retry logic. If a scraper endpoint is unavailable or returns an error, the scenario logs the failure, sends a notification to administrators, and continues processing data from other sources. Failed requests are automatically retried after a specified interval, ensuring that temporary service disruptions do not result in data loss.

Data quality validation is another critical component of this scenario. The system checks for required fields, validates image URLs, and ensures that price and area information is properly formatted. Properties that fail validation are flagged for manual review while valid properties continue through the automated pipeline.

The scenario concludes by storing the collected and normalized data in a central database or data store, such as Google Sheets, Airtable, or a dedicated database. This centralized storage serves as the single source of truth for all property data and enables other scenarios to access consistent, up-to-date information.

### Scenario 2: AI Content Enrichment Pipeline

The AI content enrichment scenario transforms raw property data into engaging, Instagram-ready content through the AI content enrichment service. This scenario is triggered either by the completion of the data collection scenario or by the availability of new property data in the central data store.

The scenario begins by retrieving batches of newly collected property listings from the central data store. To optimize processing efficiency and manage API rate limits, properties are processed in batches of 10-20 listings at a time. Each batch is sent to the AI content enrichment service via an HTTP POST request to the `/process/scraper-data` endpoint.

The enrichment request includes the property data along with configuration options that specify the desired content style and format. For example, the scenario might request "engaging" style captions for maximum social media appeal, "modern" style image overlays for contemporary visual branding, and collage creation for properties with multiple high-quality images.

The AI content enrichment service processes each property listing, generating Traditional Chinese Instagram captions that highlight key selling points, creating property information overlays on images, and producing relevant hashtags for discoverability. The service also generates concise property summaries suitable for image overlays and creates collages from multiple property photos when appropriate.

Upon receiving the enriched content from the AI service, the scenario validates the generated content to ensure quality and completeness. This validation includes checking that captions are within Instagram's character limits, verifying that image URLs are accessible, and confirming that all required fields are present in the enriched data.

The scenario then updates the central data store with the enriched content, marking properties as "ready for posting" and storing the AI-generated captions, processed image URLs, and hashtags alongside the original property data. This enriched data becomes the foundation for social media posting and lead generation activities.

Error handling in this scenario is particularly important given the complexity of AI processing. If the AI service is unavailable or returns an error for specific properties, the scenario falls back to basic content generation using predefined templates. This ensures that content creation continues even when AI services experience temporary issues.

### Scenario 3: Instagram Content Publishing

The Instagram content publishing scenario automates the posting of enriched property content to Instagram, managing posting schedules, content variety, and engagement optimization. This scenario operates on a carefully planned schedule to maximize reach and engagement while avoiding Instagram's spam detection algorithms.

The scenario begins by retrieving enriched property listings that are marked as "ready for posting" from the central data store. To maintain content variety and prevent audience fatigue, the scenario implements intelligent content selection algorithms that consider factors such as property type, price range, location, and previous posting history.

Content scheduling is a critical component of this scenario. Rather than posting all available content immediately, the scenario distributes posts throughout optimal engagement periods, typically during evening hours when the target audience is most active on social media. The scenario maintains a posting queue that ensures consistent content flow while respecting Instagram's posting frequency guidelines.

For each selected property, the scenario retrieves the AI-generated caption, processed image URL, and relevant hashtags from the enriched data. The scenario then uses Instagram's Graph API to create and publish the post, including the property image and complete caption with hashtags.

The scenario includes sophisticated duplicate detection to prevent the same property from being posted multiple times. This is particularly important when properties appear on multiple platforms or when scraper data includes updated listings that have already been posted.

Post-publication activities include immediate engagement monitoring and response preparation. The scenario tracks initial engagement metrics such as likes, comments, and saves, storing this data for later analysis. If posts receive immediate comments or direct messages, the scenario triggers lead capture workflows to ensure prompt response to potential inquiries.

The scenario also implements content performance tracking, monitoring which types of properties, caption styles, and posting times generate the highest engagement. This data feeds back into the content selection and scheduling algorithms, creating a self-improving system that optimizes performance over time.

### Scenario 4: Lead Capture and Initial Response

The lead capture scenario monitors Instagram direct messages and comments for potential property inquiries, automatically categorizing and responding to leads while routing qualified prospects to the CRM system. This scenario operates continuously, ensuring that potential leads receive immediate attention regardless of when they make contact.

The scenario uses Instagram's Webhook API to receive real-time notifications when new direct messages or comments are received on property posts. Each incoming message is immediately analyzed using natural language processing to determine the intent and urgency of the inquiry.

The analysis process examines message content for key indicators such as viewing requests, price inquiries, availability questions, and contact information. Messages containing phrases like "still available," "schedule viewing," or "more details" are automatically flagged as high-priority leads and receive immediate automated responses.

For high-priority leads, the scenario sends an immediate automated response acknowledging the inquiry and providing basic next steps. The response is personalized based on the specific property that generated the inquiry and includes relevant details such as viewing availability, contact information for the responsible agent, and additional property photos or information.

The scenario simultaneously creates a lead record in the CRM system, capturing all available information about the prospect including their Instagram profile, the specific property of interest, the original inquiry message, and the timestamp of first contact. This lead record becomes the foundation for ongoing relationship management and follow-up activities.

Medium and low-priority inquiries, such as general questions about the market or requests for information about property types, receive appropriate automated responses while being logged for later follow-up by human agents. This tiered response system ensures that high-value leads receive immediate attention while maintaining professional communication with all prospects.

The scenario includes sophisticated spam and bot detection to filter out irrelevant messages and focus human attention on genuine prospects. Messages that appear to be automated, contain suspicious links, or match known spam patterns are automatically filtered and flagged for review.

### Scenario 5: WhatsApp Integration and Lead Nurturing

The WhatsApp integration scenario extends lead capture and nurturing capabilities to WhatsApp, where many Hong Kong property seekers prefer to communicate. This scenario creates a seamless bridge between Instagram inquiries and WhatsApp conversations, enabling more detailed and personal communication with prospects.

When a lead expresses interest in continuing the conversation on WhatsApp, either through Instagram direct messages or comments, the scenario automatically initiates a WhatsApp conversation using the WhatsApp Business API. The initial WhatsApp message includes a personalized greeting, reference to the specific property inquiry, and an invitation to continue the conversation.

The scenario maintains conversation context by linking WhatsApp conversations to the original Instagram inquiry and CRM lead record. This ensures that agents have complete visibility into the lead's journey and can provide informed, personalized responses regardless of which communication channel is being used.

Automated WhatsApp responses are carefully crafted to provide value while encouraging continued engagement. For example, when a prospect inquires about a specific property, the automated response might include additional photos, floor plans, nearby amenities information, or similar property suggestions based on the prospect's expressed preferences.

The scenario implements intelligent conversation routing, directing different types of inquiries to appropriate team members based on their expertise and availability. Property viewing requests are routed to agents responsible for the specific area, while general market inquiries might be directed to market specialists or senior agents.

Lead scoring and qualification continue throughout WhatsApp conversations, with the scenario analyzing message content, response times, and engagement levels to assess lead quality and purchase intent. High-scoring leads are prioritized for human agent attention and receive enhanced service levels.

The scenario also manages conversation lifecycle, automatically following up with prospects who have not responded within specified timeframes and gracefully concluding conversations that have reached natural endpoints. This ensures that communication remains professional and valuable while avoiding spam-like behavior.
