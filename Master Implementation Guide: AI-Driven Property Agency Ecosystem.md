Effective troubleshooting requires systematic approaches to identifying, diagnosing, and resolving common issues that may impact system performance and reliability. This guide provides structured procedures for addressing typical problems while minimizing service disruption and customer impact.

**Service Connectivity Issues**

Service connectivity problems represent one of the most common categories of system issues, typically manifesting as API timeouts, connection failures, or intermittent service unavailability. These issues require systematic diagnosis to distinguish between network problems, service overload, and configuration errors.

When experiencing service connectivity issues, begin by verifying network connectivity and DNS resolution for all external services and dependencies. Use standard network diagnostic tools to test connectivity to service endpoints while checking for any network infrastructure changes or provider issues that may impact service access.

Service health endpoint testing should verify that individual services are responding correctly to health check requests while providing appropriate status information. If health checks fail, examine service logs for error messages, resource utilization issues, or configuration problems that may prevent normal operation.

Load balancer and proxy configuration should be verified to ensure that traffic routing, SSL termination, and health checking are functioning correctly. Misconfigured load balancers can cause intermittent connectivity issues that are difficult to diagnose without systematic testing.

API rate limiting and authentication issues can cause connectivity problems that appear as service failures. Verify that API keys are valid, rate limits are not exceeded, and authentication mechanisms are functioning correctly for all external service integrations.

Database connectivity issues can impact service functionality even when the service itself appears healthy. Test database connections, verify connection pool configuration, and check for database performance issues that may cause connection timeouts or failures.
