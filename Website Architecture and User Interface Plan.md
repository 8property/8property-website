# Website Architecture and User Interface Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and user interface design for the AI-driven property agency ecosystem web application. The website will serve as a comprehensive dashboard and control center for managing the entire automation ecosystem, providing real-time monitoring, analytics, and control capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### Frontend Application
- **Technology**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **State Management**: React Context API with hooks
- **Routing**: React Router for single-page application navigation
- **Charts/Visualization**: Chart.js or Recharts for analytics dashboards
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with modern design

### Backend API Gateway
- **Technology**: Flask with CORS enabled
- **Purpose**: Centralized API gateway that routes requests to appropriate services
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting and request throttling
- **Logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging

### Service Architecture
- **Microservices**: Each existing Flask service (CRM, Analytics, Scrapers, AI Enrichment)
- **Communication**: RESTful APIs between services
- **Data Flow**: Centralized through API gateway
- **Health Monitoring**: Health check endpoints for all services

## User Interface Design

### Dashboard Layout
1. **Header Navigation**
   - Logo and branding
   - Main navigation menu
   - User profile and settings
   - Real-time system status indicator

2. **Sidebar Navigation**
   - Dashboard overview

   - Lead management
   - Analytics and reports
   - System settings
   - Make.com workflow status

3. **Main Content Area**
   - Dynamic content based on selected navigation
   - Real-time data updates
   - Interactive charts and graphs
   - Data tables with filtering and sorting

### Key Pages and Features

#### 1. Dashboard Overview

- **Quick Actions**: Manual scraping triggers, content generation

#### 2. Property Management
- **Property Listings**: Grid/list view of scraped properties
- **Filtering**: By source, date, price range, location
- **Content Preview**: Generated captions and images
- **Publishing Status**: Instagram posting status and engagement metrics

#### 3. Lead Management
- **Lead Dashboard**: All leads with scoring and status
- **Lead Details**: Complete interaction history and agent assignments
- **Agent Performance**: Individual agent metrics and workload
- **Conversion Funnel**: Visual representation of lead progression

#### 4. Analytics and Reports
- **Performance Metrics**: Content engagement, lead quality, conversion rates
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical data with interactive charts
- **A/B Testing**: Test results and statistical significance
- **Custom Reports**: Exportable reports for different time periods

#### 5. System Configuration
- **Service Settings**: Configuration for each microservice
- **API Keys**: Secure management of external service credentials
- **Automation Rules**: Lead scoring, agent assignment, content generation rules
- **Make.com Integration**: Workflow status and configuration
